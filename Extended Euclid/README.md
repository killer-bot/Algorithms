In arithmetic and computer programming, the ***extended Euclidean algorithm*** is an extension to the ***Euclidean algorithm***, 
which computes, besides the greatest common divisor of integers a and b, the coefficients of ***BÃ©zout's identity***, 
that is integers x and y such that

**ax + by = gcd(a,b)**
