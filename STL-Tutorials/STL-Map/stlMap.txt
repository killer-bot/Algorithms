Problem : Monazir, a little panda, has a list of N names and their 6-digit IDs, execute Q queries. Each query asks for the ID of a person. If the person does not exist in the list print “Sorry bro!” (without quotes) else print his/her ID. Interestingly, Monazir has just returned from CIIPPUS night and is a bit high. So he may give you repeated names. So before answering any query print the number of unique names in the list.
