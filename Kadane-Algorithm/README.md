Finds the maximum subarray sum of a 1D array.  
The maximum submatrix sum of a 2D array can also be found by applying Kadane's algorithm.  
This has been illustrated in my solution for the problem UVa 108 (Maximum Sum), the code for the same can be found in the repository Solved-Programming-Problems under the section Algorithms --> Dynamic-Programming.
